# JSONParser  <br/> 
Very basic JSON Parser  <br/> 
This project is able to read data from a Json File <br/> 
It needs a shitton of external Libs:
  <br/>  gson
  <br/>  okhttp
  <br/>  okio
  <br/>  kotlin-stdlib

The second Class(myPojo) is auto-generated using this website:
http://pojo.sodhanalibrary.com/

The YouTube Video this Project is based on can be found here:

The Json-File used here is created using a nodeJS app
It runs on my personal machine and can be accessed as follows:
 &emsp; &emsp; open cmd <br/>
 cd DIRECTORY OF NODE APP <br/>
 node app.js <br/>

Exit: Strg+C
